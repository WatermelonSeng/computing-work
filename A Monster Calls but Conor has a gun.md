CHAPTER "THREE STORIES/THE GUN"

And I will give you a gun. A revolver from when I walked before.
Conor blinked. Then blinked again. “You’re going to give me a revolver?”
Indeed, the monster said.
“Well–” Conor looked around in disbelief. “How is that a nightmare?”
Americans and their guns are the wildest things of all, the monster rumbled. Americans chase and bite and
hunt.
“That’s what chinese propaganda always say,” Conor said. “No one believes it either.”
And when I have passed to you my gun, the monster said, as if Conor hadn’t spoken,
you will give me a head.
Conor squirmed in the monster’s hand. “I’m no good at decapitation.”
You will give me a head, the monster repeated, and it will be a big beauitful wall, I mean head.
“The head?”
Not just any head.The head.
“O-kay,” Conor said, “but you said I’d be scared before the end of all this, and that
doesn’t sound scary at all.”
You know that is not true, the monster said. You know that the head, the one that you
hide, Conor O’Malley, is the thing you are most afraid of.
Conor stopped squirming.
It couldn’t mean–
There was no way it could mean–
There was no way it could know that.
No. No. He was never going to say what happened in the real nightmare. Never in a
million years.
You will tell it, the monster said. For this is why you called me.
Conor grew even more confused. “Called you? I didn’t call you–”
You will give me hte head. You know, that head.
“And what if I don’t?” Conor said.
The monster gave the evil grin again. Then I will take the gun back

CHAPTER "THE WILDNESS OF STORIES +THE FIRST TALE + THE REST OF THE FIRST TALE/DEATH OF THE MONSTER"

It is time for me to tell you the communist manifesto, the monster said.
Conor didn’t move from the garden chair, where he’d sat himself after he’d gone outside.
He had his legs pulled up to his chest and his face pressed into his knees.
Are you listening? the monster asked.
“No,” Conor said.
He felt the air swirl around him violently again. I will be listened to! started the monster.
I have been alive as long as this land and you will pay the respect owed to me–
Conor got up from the chair and headed back towards the kitchen door.
Where do you think you’re go---? demanded the monster.
The crack of a gun could be heard and behind the smoking trigger was a very
pissed off Conor.
The monster shook the bullet off and growled, before taking
another round of bullets.
As the smoke dissipated once again, the monster never came back up.
Conor stared at it for a while. Then he went to the kitchen to get a shovel to bury it out in
his backyard.

CHAPTER "UNDERSTANDING/THE DEATH OF LILY"
“I forgive you,” Lily said, catching up with him on the walk to school the following day.
“For what?” Conor asked, not looking at her. He was still irritated at the monster’s dead body
taking up so much space.
“I forgive you for getting me in trouble, stupid,” Lily said, but not too harshly.
“You got yourself in trouble,” Conor said. “You’re the one who pushed Sully over.”
“I forgive you for lying,” Lily said, her poodly curls shoved painfully back into a band.
Conor just kept on walking.
“Aren’t you going to say you’re sorry back?” Lily asked.
“Nope,” Conor said.
“Why not?”
“Because I’m not sorry.”
“Conor–”
“I’m not sorry,” Conor said, stopping, “and I don’t forgive you.”
They glared at each other in the cool morning sun, neither wanting to be the first to look
away.
Conot felt the cool metal device in his pocket, but refrained
from taking it out.
“My mum said we need to make allowances for you,” Lily finally said. “Because of what
you’re going through.”
And for a moment, the sun seemed to go behind the clouds. For a moment, all Conor
could see was sudden thunderstorms on the way, could feel them ready to explode in the sky and
through his body and out of his fists. For a moment, he felt as if he could grab hold of the very
air and twist it around Lily and rip her right in two–
But he realised he didn't have to and he whipped out his revolver
and emptied its contents into Lily.

CHAPTER "AMERICANS DONT GET MUCH HOLIDAY/AMERICANS LOVE GUNS"

His father let out a long breath, the kind of breath that said bad news was coming. “Just a
few days, I’m afraid.”
Conor turned to him. “That’s all?”
“Americans don’t get much holiday, but we do get guns.”
“You’re not American.”
“But I live there now.” He grinned. “You’re the one who made fun of my accent all
night.”
“Why did you come then?” Conor asked. “Why bother coming at all?”
His father waited a moment before answering. “I came because your mum asked me to.”
He looked like he was going to say more, but he didn’t.
Conor didn’t say anything either.
“I’ll come back, though,” his father said. “You know, when I need to.” His voice
brightened. “And you’ll visit us at Christmas! That’ll be good fun.”
“In your cramped house where there’s no room for me,” Conor said.
“Conor–”
“And then I’ll come back here for school.”
“Con–”
“Why did you come?” Conor asked again, his voice low.
His father didn’t answer. A silence opened up in the car that felt like they were sitting on
opposite sides of a canyon. Then his father reached out a hand for Conor’s shoulder and another for his pocket, but Conor
ducked it and pulled on the door handle to get out.
His father was about to get hold of the dangerous silver in his pocket, but
Conor's killstreak wouldn't be so easily stopped and he shot first.
There was silence.
Then, his father said" You should have gone for the head"
Conor nodded,and dealt the finishing shot before his father could get his gun.
Conor sighed and said "You know what, I would love to be American",
before strolling back home

CHAPTER "THE REST OF THE SECOND TALE/GUN THE HOUSE DOWN"

Conor could feel his breathing growing heavy again. His heart was racing and that
feverish feeling had come over him once more. He waited a long moment.
Then he said, “Shoot the damn fireplace.”
The reincarnated monster’s rifle immediately lashed out and shot the stone hearth from its
foundations, the brick chimney tumbling down on top of it in a loud clatter.
Conor’s breath got heavier still, like he was the one doing the destroying.
“Mow down their beds,” he said.
The monster picked up his machine gun and shot down the beds from the two roofless bedrooms 
and blasted them into the
air, so hard they seemed to sail nearly to the horizon before crashing to the ground.
“Shoot their furniture!” Conor shouted. “Shoot everything!”
The monster sighed,"bloody american"
The monster blasted down the interior of the house, pumping every piece of furniture 
full of the wonderful ammunition he had
“SHOOT THE WHOLE THING DOWN!” Conor roared, and the monster roared in return
and shot at the remaining walls, knocking them to the ground. Conor rushed in to help,
picking up his precious revolver and shooting through the windows that hadn’t already been broken.
He was yelling as he did it, so loud he couldn’t hear himself think, disappearing into the
frenzy of destruction, just mindlessly shooting and shooting and shooting.
The monster was right. It was very satisfying.
Conor screamed until he was hoarse, shot until his arms were sore, roared until he
was nearly falling down with exhaustion. When he finally stopped, he found the monster
watching him quietly from outside the wreckage. Conor panted and leaned on the branch to keep
himself balanced.
Now that, said the monster, is how destruction is properly done.
And suddenly they were back in Conor’s grandma’s sitting room.
Conor saw that he had destroyed almost every inch of it.

CHAPTER "DESTRUCTION/DESTRUCTION"

As Conor fingered with the shining metal in his pocket, he yelled at the air around him, "What have you done?"
No answer came.
And he saw his grandma's car pulling in the driveway.
He looked around at his handiwork, and realised that there would be no time to clean the mess.
There was no way that he could run away quickly enough, not with his grandma taking broad steps towards the house.
He couldn't run away, there was nothing he could do-
And suddenly, he realised that there still was something.
It wasn't the best idea, but it would work.
Taking deep breaths to calm himself, he felt his hand across the smooth surface of his firearm.
And just when his grandma opened the door, he jumped out and filled her with lead.
All this before she could even say anything.
Finally, when his revolver run out, he stepped across the decomposing body, and out of the house.

CHAPTER "KILLINGS"

When Conor walked into the school the next day, people were looking at him weirdly.
Probably because he was a serial killer.
Lily was already in the graveyard.
And Conor guessed that even if she was alive, she wouldn't speak to him.
As he waited by the stone wall, he saw Harry, Sully and Anton.
He felt weak with relief.
That day passed slowly for Conor, but he didn't care.
Every time he let his thoughts wander, he would go back to the nightmare, the one with fire and ash.
And every time _that_ happened, he would get angry.
Then, he would finger the piece of metal in his pocket again.
If he couldn't take it anymore, he would take it out, and start killing.
And so it continued.
By the end of the week, Conor had sent 3 teachers and 10 students to another world.

CHAPTER "I NO LONGER SEE YOU"

There was no hope of paying attention in lessons.
Which, once again, didn't matter because none of the teachers asked him a question anyway.
Neither did his classmates.
By the time lunch break came around. he'd passed another morning not having said a word to anyone.
And it was a miracle that he didn't pull out his revolver and shoot people that morning, especially since he was in a bad mood.
He sat alone at the far edge of the dining hall, his food uneaten in front of him.
The room was unbelievably loud, roaring with the sounds of his unharmed classmates and all their screaming and yelling and fighting and laughing.
Conor did his best to ignore it.
Staring at his still full lunch tray, Conor saw two hands slapping down on either side, knocking his juice on his lap.
Looking up, Conor saw Anton and Sully, laughing and pissing him off.
And here came Harry.
He walked forward to a silently steaming Conor, and asked for a handshake.
They shook hands.
"Goodbye, O'Malley," Harry muttered, "I no longer see you."

CHAPTER "MASSACRE"

And here was the monster.
"It is time for the third tale, but I don't think that will be neccessary." The monster growled.
"Why?" Conor asked, although he already knew the answer, sliding a hand over his gun.
"Because, there is a fairly easy way to make them see."
Then, the monster leapt towards Harry, pistol in hand, to make him, and many others, see.

CHAPTER "PUNISHMENT"

"O'Malley, if you wish to unleash your anger, this is not the way to do it."
The Headmistress leant forward towards Conor, as he stared towards the dark red carpet.
He flexed his fists.
They were sore again, just like when he destroyed his grandma's house.
He had felt what had happened.
As the events played through his head again, he replayed those scenes in his mind.
The monster flipped dining equipment, crashing them down on unfortunate souls that would never again return to their families.
He used his pistol to fill Harry with ammunition.
